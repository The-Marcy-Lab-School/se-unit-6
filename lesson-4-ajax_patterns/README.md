# Lesson 4: AJAX Patterns

## Key Terms
* AJAX
* `fetch`
* XML
* JSON
* Async
* Optimistic Rendering
* Pessimistic Rendering

## Essential Questions
* How does asynchronously programming and the ability to make AJAX requests impact our applications?
* How can we structure our code to make our applications easy to read and maintain?

## Learning Assignments
* [AJAX on MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
  * [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
  * [Parsing and Serializing XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML) - *NOTE* - XML is another format for sending data. Today, JSON, or "JavaScript Object Notation" is much more popular for most sources.
* [Build your Own AJAX Web Apps](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-your-own-ajax-web-apps/) - This article has a great overview of the history of AJAX web applications. The tutorial is a bit dated, so focus more on the concepts as opposed to the actual implementation if you go through it.
* [AJAX: A New Approach to Web Applications](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c440/ae765ff19ddd3deda24a92ac39cef9570f1e.pdf?_ga=2.268896824.850628240.1580156025-1688752874.1580156025) - This is the original paper which coined the term "AJAX".
