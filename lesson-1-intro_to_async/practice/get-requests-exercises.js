/**
 * EXERCISE 1:
 * Read this analogous conversation related to Promises.
 * Aftwerwards, explain the parts of his analogy to describe
 * how asynchronous calls and promises work.
 *
 * 		Raul: Hey Mx. Promise! Can you run to the store down the street
 * 		and get me itemA for this dish we are cooking tonight?
 *
 * 		Mx. Promise: Sure thing!
 *
 * 		Raul: While you are doing that, I will prepare itemB.
 * 		But make sure you let me know whether you could find itemA.
 *
 *		Mx. Promise: What if you are not at home when I am back?
 *
 *		Raul: In that case, send me a text message saying you are
 *		back and have the item for me.
 * 		If you donâ€™t find it, call me back immediately.
 *
 * 		Mx. Promise: Sounds good! See you in a bit.
 */

const response1 = `
    A promise in JavaScript represents the possible resolving, rejecting or pending state of an asynchronous operation. A promise is a returned object, that developers attach callbacks to. 
    
    In the example above, Raul's request is similar to an AJAX request. While the request is being sent off, the preparation of itemB is occurring, much like an asynchronous operation. What is returned is will either be the data that has been fetched (in this case the item) or callback that will deal with the state of rejection of the request.
